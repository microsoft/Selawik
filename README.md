# Microsoft Selawik
Selawik is an open source replacement for Segoe UI. 

[Microsoft's Open Source Fonts](https://github.com/Microsoft/fonts)

## Known open issues:
* Selawik is missing kerning to match Segoe UI. 
* Selawik needs improved hinting. 

## File format
The original multiple-master source files are in the [Glyphs][] editor format.
Conversion to UFO is provided with designspace files that define the
interpolation points. If you don't have access to Glyphs, try using
[GlyphsLib][] for interconversion.
